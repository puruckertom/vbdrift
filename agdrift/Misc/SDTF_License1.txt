SOFTWARE PRODUCT LICENSE

The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international copyright 
treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The rights granted to 
you by this LICENSE AGREEMENT constitute a license, not a transfer of title.

1. GRANT OF LICENSE. Except as otherwise provided herein, this LICENSE 
AGREEMENT grants you a limited, royalty-free, revocable and non-transferable license 
for the right to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT including the object code of the 
software release specified therein during the term hereof as an educational, 
governmental, and management tool for assessing and mitigating pesticide spray drift 
and for educating applicators of pesticides in pesticide spray drift reduction. As a 
Licensee, you shall not decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to discover 
the source code of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT nor authorize or permit others to do so. 
Non-governmental Licensees shall not use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT in any litigation, 
including without limitation judicial and administrative proceedings. To install or use the 
SOFTWARE PRODUCT in a manner not expressly licensed by the terms and 
conditions of this LICENSE AGREEMENT, you must seek a modification of the 
LICENSE AGREEMENT as provided for herein, which modification the Task Force in its 
sole discretion may agree to provide.

2. PESTICIDE REGISTRATION DATA. Notwithstanding the foregoing GRANT OF 
LICENSE, the SOFTWARE PRODUCT shall not be used to support directly or indirectly 
the registration, continued registration, or amended registration of a pesticide product – 
including without limitation pesticide registration, reregistration, tolerance exemption, 
tolerance setting, and any related risk or exposure assessments, whether in the United 
States or any of its states, territories, or other subdivisions or in any jurisdiction outside 
the United States – to benefit a person or entity unless such person or entity is 
expressly authorized in writing by the Task Force to rely upon Task Force data. In 
addition to the foregoing, governmental entities performing the above-described 
pesticide-related regulatory purposes may use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT for such 
pesticide-related regulatory purposes for the benefit of a person or entity entitled to rely 
upon Task Force data by virtue of a binding offer to pay compensation for such use 
under § 3(c)(1)(F)(iii) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act 
(FIFRA), 7 U.S.C. § 136a(c)(1)(F)(iii), or other provisions of law that provide identical 
protections to owners and submitters of data. You recognize that the SOFTWARE 
PRODUCT is based upon, and validated for the foregoing pesticide-related regulatory 
purposes by data owned by the Task Force.

3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; CONFIDENTIALITY. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is 
the intellectual property of the Task Force and is licensed to each Licensee only as 
expressly provided by this LICENSE AGREEMENT. All other rights are reserved. The 
Task Force’s intellectual property rights in the SOFTWARE PRODUCT include, without 
limitation, all data incorporated into and all output generated by or from the SOFTWARE 
PRODUCT and each reference herein to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT includes, without 
limitation, such data and output. You shall not remove any copyright or other proprietary 
notices contained in the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and may not distribute, transfer or 
publish the SOFTWARE PRODUCT without the express written permission of the Task 
Force. AgDRIFT® is a registered trademark of the Spray Drift Task Force. Each end 
user is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their own account number 
and/or password, if applicable.

4. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION. By installing or using this SOFTWARE 
PRODUCT, you agree that all matters relating to such installation or use shall be 
governed by the statutes and laws of the District of Columbia, without regard to the 
conflicts of law principles thereof. You and the Task Force agree and hereby submit to 
the personal jurisdiction of, and exclusive venue in, the Superior Court of District of 
Columbia and the United States District Court for the District of Columbia with respect to 
such matters, except that – for matters regarding the amount of compensation owed to 
the Task Force arising from use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT – you or the Task Force 
may initiate binding arbitration in the District of Columbia under the terms of this 
LICENSE AGREEMENT. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Task Force 
finds, in its sole discretion, that it might suffer irreparable loss or harm to any of its 
intellectual property rights as a result of your breach of this LICENSE AGREEMENT, 
then the Task Force may, but shall not be required to, pursue any and all equitable or 
legal remedies in any court of competent jurisdiction pending outcome of the arbitration 
proceedings as otherwise provided for herein.

5. ARBITRATION OF COMPENSATION CLAIMS. If the Task Force loses any data 
compensation rights in the SOFTWARE PRODUCT as the result of breach of this 
LICENSE AGREEMENT by you or any person or entity for which you are responsible 
under this LICENSE AGREEMENT, you offer and agree to compensate the Task Force 
for such loss (including attorneys fees) and agree to submit such matter to binding 
arbitration in the same manner provided by FIFRA § 3(c)(1)(F)(iii), 7 U.S.C. 
§ 136a(c)(1)(F)(iii).

6. INDEMNIFICATION. You are responsible for any and all use of the SOFTWARE 
PRODUCT that you install, and you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the

FIFRA and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (‘FFDCA’) establish certain U.S. 
Government rights and duties with respect to data, such as the SOFTWARE

Government may distribute or disclose the SOFTWARE PRODUCT within the U.S. 
Government pursuant to subparagraphs (c)(1) and (2) of the Commercial Computer

hereby under such subparagraphs shall not extend to distribution or disclosure in a 
manner – including without limitation posting on an Internet host server or Internet site – 
accessible to persons not expressly included under such subparagraphs. Except as 
otherwise expressly provided by the CRADA, FIFRA, FFDCA, or this LICENSE 
AGREEMENT, the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed to U.S. Government end users 
with only those rights granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and 
conditions herein.

8. TASK FORCE MEMBER RIGHTS. The Task Force Joint Data Development 
Agreement establishes certain rights and duties with respect to the SOFTWARE

written consent, if required, of the Bureau of Export Administration of the U.S. 
Department of Commerce, or such other governmental entity as may have jurisdiction 
over such export or transmission. You agree that you do not intend to and will not, 
directly or indirectly, post or permit the posting of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT on an 
Internet host server or Internet site.

11. TERM AND TERMINATION. This LICENSE AGREEMENT enters into effect 
immediately and automatically upon your first installation or use of the SOFTWARE 
PRODUCT and continues in effect until the Task Force discontinues the release 
licensed hereunder; PROVIDED, however, that your obligations as a Licensee herein 
survive the expiration or termination of your license to install or to use the SOFTWARE

LICENSE AGREEMENT if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this 
LICENSE AGREEMENT. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE

14. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER: TASK FORCE (INCLUDING ITS OFFICERS, 
MEMBERS, AND AGENTS) EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY FOR THE 
SOFTWARE PRODUCT. THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT AND ANY RELATED 
DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED ‘AS IS’ WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, 
OR NONINFRINGEMENT OR OF THE QUALITY, ACCURACY, SUITABILITY OF THE 
RESULTS GENERATED FROM THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT FOR 
PREDICTING SPRAY DRIFT, WHICH DEPENDS ON ACTUAL USE CONDITIONS. 
THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE 
SOFTWARE PRODUCT REMAINS WITH YOU.

15. NO LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES. In no event shall Task Force (including its Officers,

limitation, indirect or consequential damages for loss of business profits, business 
interruption, loss of business information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the 
use of or inability to use this Task Force product, even if it has been advised of the 
possibility of such damages. Without limiting the above, the Task Force (including its 
Officers, Members, or agents) specifically disclaims any responsibility or liability for the 
reliability or accuracy of the results generated through use of the SOFTWARE 
PRODUCT to determine or control spray drift or for updating or supporting the 
SOFTWARE PRODUCT. Because some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion 
or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may 
not apply to you.
