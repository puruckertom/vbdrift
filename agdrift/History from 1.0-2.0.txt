'*********************************************************
'1.11 <- 1.10
'1.10 <- 1.09
'1.09 <- 1.08
'1.08 <- 1.07
'- Modified Preferences screen to accept list of "Tiers"
'  comparable to that on the "Tier" menu, rather than
'  discrete Tier number and application method (and now,
'  audience)
'- Added new Canopy section to UserData
'- Added new Canopy form
'- Added Smokey to Userdata to designate "audience" as SDTF
'  (0) or Forest Service (1)
'- Removed preference allowing initial info screen to be
'  skipped. Now info screen is always displayed at startup.
'- Added new Orchard Airblast (OA) section to UserData
'  consisting of BASICTYP, BEGTROW, ENDTROW
'- Changed meaning of UD.GA.BasicType as a result of new OA
'  section. 0-2 low boom m,c,vc 3-5 high boom m,c,vc
'- Divided UD.SM.SPECGRAV into SpecGrav (tank mix) and
'  NonVGrav (nonvolatiles only)
'- Added aircraft multi-engine capability. New variables
'  NumEng, EngHoriz(2)
'- Changed handling of nozzle positions by introducing the
'  concept of a spray boom associated with the aircraft
'  New variables WingVert, BoomVert, BoomFwd
'- Changed HGTCAN to SRuff (Surface Roughness), since an
'  actual canopy model will be introduced
'- Added half-boom spray capability. New variable HalfBoom
'- Added ability to edit nozzle positions independently
'  in all three directions. Redesigned nozzle screen
'  to accomodate.
'- Above modification required changing PosVert and PosFwd
'  to arrays (60) in NozzleData section of UserData.
'- Added Nozzle type (NozType) to Nozzle Data to support
'  DSD selection for each nozzle. The idea is to be able to
'  choose from three different drop distributions for each
'  nozzle.
'- Changed the DSD structure to an array of Three DSD structures
'  in support of the above modification.
'- Changed the DK structure to an array of three structures also.
'1.07 <- 1.06
'- Fixed bug in Stream Assessment where manual entry of the
'  four distances/times would not be properly read
'- Added Multiple Application Assessment Toolbox
'1.06 <- 1.05
'- Added RCS headers to code and forms for version control
'- Added file existance checking for Export file dialogs
'- Added BoomWidth to NozzleData;
'        NumFA, FADist, FAVal to UserCalc
'  These additions required updates to:
'  GetBasicDataNZ, GenReportText, UserDataRead/Write,
'  introduced UserDataReadOld.
'- user file format moved from 0 to 1 to support above additions.
'- Added a new plot for Fraction Aloft based on the new
'  NumFA, FADist and FAVAL.
'  Required changes to all the plot setup routines and
'  to the export data routines and form. Introduced a new
'  constant PV_FA to support the new plot.
'- UserCalc was redefined to make its data arrays dynamic. In their
'  static form, they caused the total static storage size to exceed
'  64k, which is a no-no in VB16. Routines that modified the UserCalc
'  data arrays were changed to handle dynamic allocation, and the
'  Fortran routines that took UC as an argument were changed to allow
'  individual arrays as arguments. The UserCalc structure was then
'  removed from the agdstruc.inc fortran include file.
'- Easter Egg screen credits modified
'- Numerical Values screen labels changed: "Accountancy" ->
'  "Accountancy of Active", "Evaporation" -> "Carrier Evaporation"
'- Changed DropKick default pressure from 40 psi to 60 (4.137 bar)
'- Added Milt's new routine agstrm.for to DLL to support Stream Assessment
'- Added new form frmTBStream: Stream Toolbox
'- Added new constant PV_STRM to support Stream Assessment
'- Changed Spray Material fields for NV amount, Active amount, and
'  spray rate to "adjust" their amounts only when pressing the
'  enter key, rather than after each change. This fixes the behavior
'  where erasing the Spray Rate would cause the previous two
'  values to change based on a (momentary) value of zero for
'  the spray rate.
'1.05 <- 1.04
'- Added closing paren to Nonvol Rate in GenReportText
'- Changed "Nonvol." to Nonvolatile in GenReportText
'- Milt: Change to agkrn.for, atomize.out
'1.04 <- 1.03
'- Fortran DLL mods from Milt
'- nozzle.out database mods from Milt
'- Correctly handle nozzle distribution name on main form
'- Change all Dropkick to DropKick
'- On calc form, dim Start button after calcs
'1.03 <- 1.02
'- Corrections to standard and SDTF Libraries
'- Mods to FORTRAN limit routines
'1.02 <- 1.01
'- Fix: Previously the plot label units were set up in
'  GenCalcPlotData, which assumed that there would always
'  be "Current Data" in the plot. That is not always the
'  case. Created separated routine GenPlotUnits to take
'  care of the task of setting the units strings, and
'  added a call to it in GenPlotData.
'- Changed Aquatic Assessment form so that Active Rate is
'  taken from UserData only the first time the form is shown.
'  Subsequently the form remembers the value and adjusts it
'  to reflect any changes in units.
'- Changed Spray Block Assessment form to support being hidden
'  (instead of unloaded) as does Aquatic Asessment. Also added
'  Active Rate value behavior similar to Aquatic Assessment.
'- added "(default)" after "Medium" in Tier 1 form
'- added "(Red entry indicated user input)" to calculations
'  frames in Aquatic Assessment Toolbox and Spray Block
'  Assessment Toolbox
'- Removed all VB3 global constants and changed over to
'  VB4 built-in constants.
'1.01 <- 1.0 (released 6/9/97)
'- Changed access to Easter egg screen to simply double-
'  clicking on the TM on the About form. Previously one
'  had to hold down ctrl-alt-shift, type "agdrift", then
'  double click on the TM.
'- Added hourglass pointer when changing type on DSD,
'  DropKick, Aircraft, and Spray Material forms.
'- Bug: Tier 2 now updates basic nozzle data when new
'  aircraft is selected.
'- Changed GetBasicDataNZ to set NZ.PosHorizLimit from 0
'  (was 75)
'- Changed DropKick SM defaults to match new library data
'- Made position of OK, Cancel buttons consistent among
'  forms. Ok on left, Cancel in LR corner.
'- Added Nozzle Pressure field and filter to DSD Lib form
'  to support the addition of pressure data in the database
'- Added function QueryPerformCalcs to unify asking the user
'  to perform calcs before continuing.
'- Added checks in GenCalcPlotData to see not only if calcs
'  are valid, but also if there is calc data present. This
'  handles Field Trial library entries, which contain
'  incomplete calculations.
'- Added checks in Effective Swath Width toolbox for nonempty
'  COV calc data and in Spray Block Assessment toolbox for
'  nonempty Single-swath deposition. The handles Field Trial
'  library entries which contain incomplete calculations.
'- Fixed Plot form so that it correctly returns to the
'  previous successful plot after aborting a PlotVar switch
'- Introduced global consts for MAX_DROPS and MAX_NOZZLES to
'  arrays sizes for drops and nozzles.
'- Modified Dropsize and Nozzles forms to zero out remainder
'  of arrays after defining new data. This helps ensure proper
'  display in Input Summary
'- Modified Input Summary to display the full lists of drops
'  and nozzles when user and default sizes are different.
'1.0 (released 6/3/97 to training session in Baltimore)
