The following is the change log from AgDRIFT prior to the
release of version 1.0. This text is a series of comment lines
that were in the General sectionof  agdrift1.bas. They were
removed when version 1.0 was released, but were retained here
for future reference.

'*********************************************************
'History
'*********************************************************
'Changes: Beta version 0.18 -> Version 1.0 ***************
'- Changed Info form: Made "Even though..." a separate paragraph
'  and added "Approval is expected in 1998."
'- Changed orchard order to Normal Dense Sparse in Tier 1
'  and Tier I Library forms
'- Added "Easter Egg" screen
'- Changed Surface Roughness default from .005 to .0075
'- Fixed batch operations where the last file did not
'  update the "data changed" flag properly
'- Changed orchard order on Tier1, Tier1Lib forms to Normal, Dense, Sparse
'- Removed printing of vertical line at extrapolation point for
'  field trial deposition plots, but left all coding in place
'- Added "TM" Symbol to AgDRIFT on forms
'Changes: Beta version 0.17 -> Beta version 0.18 ***************
'(Released 4/2/97)
'- Fixed Aquatic Assessment Toolbox: Wasn't tracking changed to
'  user defined pond dimensions when changing from EPA-defined.
'  If you clicked "User-defined", then entered numbers, everything
'  worked well. If you simply entered new pond dimensions and let
'  the pond type flip automatically, the internal pond type wasn't
'  properly updated and EPA numbers were used for the calc.
'- Added LibraryPath to UserInterface structure to handle
'  Standard/SDTF Libraries
'- Incorporated library search algorithm. The idea is this: The
'  distribution of AgDRIFT will include a standard library
'  (agdrift.mdb). Members of the SDTF will receive a special library
'  (agdsdtf.mdb). If the SDTF library is present, AgDRIFT will use
'  it and ignore the standard library. If only the standard library
'  is present, AgDRIFT will use it. If neither library is present,
'  AgDRIFT will present an error message and terminate gracefully.
'- Added "Aircraft Centerline" as type 4 for Swath Displacement type
'  for Tier II/III
'- Removed "Nonsquare" from "EPA Nonsquare ..." on toolboxes
'- Changed "Downind Distance" to "Downwind Pond Width" on TBAquatic
'  and TBSprayBlock
'- Add input for Pond Width on TBSprayBlock
'- Fixed dimming of Number of Swaths controls on Tier 1
'Changes: Demonstration version 16 -> Beta version 0.17 ***************
'(Build 4 released 3/24/97)
'- Handle systems with no printer configured.
'- Remove agdrift.rvt file on program exit.
'- Fixed plotting so that when the plot variable is changed on the plot
'  form to a variable that cannot be displayed (i.e. calculation need to
'  be done), the plot reverts to the previous variable.
'- Fixed Tier 1 dep and PID plots to correctly reset the extrapolation
'  variable when moving from aerial to ground/orchard and back.
'(Build 1 released 3/19/97 to Dave Esterly)
'- changed display of version number to show the "real" number described
'  as as "Beta" version. Previously the version number was divided by 100
'  and displayed as a "Demonstration" version. (e.g. version 0.16 was
'  "Demonstration version 16" whereas 0.17 is "Beta version 0.17"
'- added BasicSGL table to library for Tier 1 Single-swath Deposition
'- changed GetTier1Calcs to support Single-swath deposition
