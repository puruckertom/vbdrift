SOFTWARE PRODUCT LICENSE

The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, 
as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The rights granted to you by this 
LICENSE AGREEMENT constitute a license, not a transfer of title.

1. GRANT OF LICENSE. This LICENSE AGREEMENT grants you the right to use the 
SOFTWARE PRODUCT for noncommercial purposes as an educational and management 
tool for mitigating pesticide spray drift and for educating applicators of pesticides in 
pesticide spray drift reduction.  You may not decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise 
attempt to discover the source code of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.  You may not use the 
SOFTWARE PRODUCT (which includes output) in any litigation, including without 
limitation judicial and administrative proceedings.

2. PESTICIDE REGISTRATION DATA.  Without otherwise limiting the terms of the 
LICENSE AGREEMENT, the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (which includes output) cannot be 
used for any regulatory purpose - including without limitation pesticide registration, 
reregistration, exemption, or tolerance-setting, whether in the United States or any of its 
states, territories, or other subdivisions or in any jurisdiction outside the United States - for 
the benefit of a person or entity not expressly authorized by the Task Force to rely upon Task 
Force data or entitled to rely upon Task Force data by virtue of a binding offer to pay 
compensation under § 3(c)(1)(F)(iii) of the Federal Insecticide. Fungicide, and Rodenticide 
Act (FIFRA), 7 U.S.C. § 136a(c)(1)(F)(iii), or other provisions of law that provide identical 
protections to owners and submitters of data.  You recognize that the SOFTWARE 
PRODUCT (which includes output) is based upon and validated by data owned by the Task

without the express written permission of the Task Force.  You are responsible for 
maintaining the confidentiality of your account number and/or password, if applicable. You

by the statutes and laws of the District of Columbia, without regard to the conflicts of law 
principles thereof. You and the Task Force agree and hereby submit to the exclusive personal 
jurisdiction and venue of the federal and Superior Court of District of Columbia and the 
United States District Court for the District of Columbia with respect to such matters, except 
that - for matters regarding the amount of compensation owed to the Task Force arising from 
use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (which includes output) - you or the Task Force may 
initiate binding arbitration in the District of Columbia under the terms of this LICENSE 
AGREEMENT.

compensation rights in the SOFTWARE PRODUCT as the result of breach of this LICENSE 
AGREEMENT by you or any person or entity for which you are responsible under this

(including attorneys fees) and agree to submit such matter to binding arbitration in the same 
manner provided by FIFRA § 3(c)(1)(F)(iii), 7 U.S.C. § 136a(c)(1)(F)(iii); PROVIDED, 
however, that in the event that Task Force finds, in its sole discretion, that it will suffer 
irreparable loss or harm to any of its intellectual property as a result of such breach of this 
LICENSE AGREEMENT, then Task Force may, but shall not be required to, pursue any and 
all equitable or legal remedies in any court of competent jurisdiction pending outcome of the 
arbitration as provided for herein.

6. INDEMNIFICATION. You are responsible for any and all use of the SOFTWARE 
PRODUCT that you install and you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Task 
Force from any liability or expense arising from such use or misuse.  You further agree to 
immediately notify the Task Force of any unauthorized use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT 
that you install or any other breach of this LICENSE AGREEMENT known to you.

such other governmental entity as may have jurisdiction over such export or transmission.

LIMITED WARRANTY

NO WARRANTIES. Task Force (including its Officers, Members, and agents) expressly 
disclaims any warranty for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT and any 
related documentation is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express or 
implied, including, without limitation, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a 
particular purpose, or noninfringement or of the quality, accuracy, suitability of the results 
generated from the use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT for predicting spray drift, which depends 
on actual use conditions. The entire risk arising out of use or performance of the SOFTWARE

NO LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES. In no event shall Task Force (including its Officers, 
Members, or agents) be liable for any damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, 
damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or any 
other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability to use this Task Force product, even if

(including its Officers, Members, or agents) specifically disclaims any responsibility or liability 
for the reliability or accuracy of the results generated through use of the SOFTWARE 
PRODUCT to determine or control spray drift.  Because some states/jurisdictions do not allow 
the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above 
limitation may not apply to you.
